Saving the world with meals on wheels. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You've swallowed a planet! Saving the world with meals on wheels. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. *Hey*, the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
