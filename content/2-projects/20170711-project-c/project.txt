Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I like seafood. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.

God created pudding, and then he rested. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. __With my own set of rules.__ *I'm Dexter.* Boo.

### Under normal circumstances

I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I'm really more an apartment person.

1. I'm generally confused most of the time.
2. You look…perfect.
3. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Tell him time is of the essence. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast.

I like seafood. Hello, Dexter Morgan. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm partial to air conditioning. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

* I'm generally confused most of the time.
* You look…perfect.
* Only you could make those words cute.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.
