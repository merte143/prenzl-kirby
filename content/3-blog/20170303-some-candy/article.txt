And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

Why not indeed! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Bender, being God isn't easy. __If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope.__ *You have to use a light touch.* Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

1. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!
2. Shut up and get to the point!
3. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
