Text: 

When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

You fight like a younger man, there's nothing held back. It's admirable, but mistaken.

But it's not who you are underneath... it's what you do that defines you.

It's ends here.

You're taller than you look in the tabIoids, Mr. Wayne.

Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.

If you're good at something, never do it for free.

This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.

I'm Gotham's reckoning. It'll end the ball of damns you've all been living on. A necessary evil.

You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.

It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan.

I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.
